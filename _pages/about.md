## About This Site

This is Shane's blog about all things coffee, tea, and caffienated beverages, and especially about his favorite coffee shop, Peet's.  He likes most of them, and drinks a lot of coffee, so read on!

## If you want to be awesome

  - Try out your local Peet's store if you have one, and smile at the staff.
  - If you don't have a local Peet's, then enjoy your favorite locally owned coffee/tea shop and smile at the staff.
  - It's amazing how much better the day is when you smile, don't you think?
