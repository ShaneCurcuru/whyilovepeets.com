Always buy fresh beans and grind just before brewing for best results!

Using a blade grinder works fine, but you do need to be careful to not let the beans overheat.  It's a trick to get the beans evenly ground, without heating them up so much they start to burn.

A burr grinder is better, but most are much more expensive.  Along with doing a much more even grind without worrying about burning the beans, they're easier to use too: just push the button for as long as you want it to grind.  This year I finally got the present I wanted: the [Baratza Virtuoso burr grinder](https://www.baratza.com/grinder/virtuoso/), and it's both beautiful and magical.
