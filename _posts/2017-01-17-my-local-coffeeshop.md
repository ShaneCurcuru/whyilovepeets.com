My default coffee? Major Dickason's Blend® coffee from Peet's. Just the right dark roast with complexity to enjoy but without too much of anything, so it's suitable for an everyday cuppa. I probably get this roast about a third of the time I buy coffee beans, or anytime I need beans but just can't decide on what I want.

Order some [Major Dickason from Peet's directly](https://www.peets.com/major-dickason-s-blend.html).

The story of the "retired army officer Key Dickason" bringing in the blend to Peet's is a nice one, although quick research doesn't show much factual data behind it.  It would be nice if Peet's corporate marketing turned it into a real story (with some data to support it).

In other news, MAJOR DICAKSON'S BLEND® is a [registered trademark in the US](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=72397592&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch), showing how important the brand is to Peet's marketing.  The registration waives "BLEND", obviously, but also interestingly states:

> "MAJOR DICKASON" IS NOT THE NAME OF ANY LIVING INDIVIDUAL KNOWN TO APPLICANT, BUT IS FANCIFUL.
