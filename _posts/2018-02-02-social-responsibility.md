Peet's is not unique among retailers working on social responsibility, but they are 
very thorough and active in their work helping the environment and their 
coffee suppliers.

[Peet's Social Responsibility listing](https://www.peets.com/about-us/social-responsibility) 
includes a pot full of programs they work with, including Direct Trade, 
USDA Organic, Fair Trade, and Rainforest Alliance certifications, plus the 
Farmer Assistance program, and community support programs including 
[Technoserve](http://www.technoserve.org/), [World Coffee Research](https://worldcoffeeresearch.org/), [Coffee Kids](http://www.coffeekids.org/), and [Grounds for Health](http://www.groundsforhealth.org/).

They always have a solid list of coffees from these programs available, both in stores and in the [Peet's online shop](https://www.peets.com/coffee/featured-category/people-planet.html). 

Peet's also works on various energy and recycling programs.  What I especially like is their bag recycling program: if you bring back your bean bag (or use your own [Airscape canister](https://smile.amazon.com/Airscape-Coffee-Food-Storage-Canister/dp/B002UK4HQQ)!), they give you a 25 cent discount on your bean purchase - even for just a half pound!  Not a silly dime discount like some other shops.
