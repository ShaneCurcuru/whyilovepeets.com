Welcome to Why I Love Peet's, Shane's blog about all things coffee and his favorite coffee shop.

## Welcome

Welcome to Why I Love Peet’s, my online homage to [Peet’s Coffee & Tea](http://www.peets.com/store-locator) shops. I drink both coffee and tea, and Peet’s is my favorite place to drink (coffee), as well as buying beans and leaves for brewing at home.

Just as a reminder: Peet’s ® and various other Peet’s logos, brands, trade dress, and the like are [trademarks of Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Inc.](http://www.peets.com/terms-of-service) Peet’s is not affiliated with nor endorses this website, and so far Peet’s probably doesn’t know that I exist - except for of course the baristas at my favorite local shop!

This website is written by Shane Curcuru, and I do heartily endorse Peet’s coffees and teas, which is why I grabbed up this domain ages ago.

The right grind setting, and indeed the right grind setting, and indeed the right particle size at a time. Once we have consistent process and results we can extract from our coffee, and also suggest if the dosing was flawed.
